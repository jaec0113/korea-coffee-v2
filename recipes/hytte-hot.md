1. Rinse the filter and dispose of the rinse water.
2. Pour 2.5-3x the coffee weight (37-45g) in hot water to bloom. Use a spoon or stick and stir the bloom.
3. Let bloom for 30 seconds. (0:00 - 0:30)
4. Pour to 260g total weight in a very heavy pour to the brewer's side to spin the slurry. 
5. Let drain completely. (~2:00)

(*note* pots with a slower flow rate may not be able to pour fast enough to create this effect)
